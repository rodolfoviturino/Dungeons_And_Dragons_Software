# I made this repository to share a program that creates new playable characters (saves and loads them as well) based in the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) 5th edition game. 

Here are some considerations before you dive deep into the code: this program was not meant to have all of the best practices in python programming, mainly because I made it while I was having my very first contact using python tkinter GUI tool. Learning a bit about Tkinter functionalities was my goal, which I believe successfully I achieved.

I do not have the intention on creating a fully gaming system software that comprehends each and every feature that d&d game demands. But, if you find this program interesting, want to report any bug based on what is already implemented, or even want to continue this project, please contact me. This is my e-mail where you can find me at: rodolfo.viturino@hotmail.com

I also exported this software as an executable file which anyone can test on windows without even having to install python nor any dependency (this was tested with windows 10 home, but I believe anything above windows 7 should also do). In order to execute the program, extract the "player_validator" folder from the "player_validator.zip" file and look for the "player_validator.exe". Double click on that and "voil√†", the program should start running.

Finally, here are some features that I already know that could be implemented for a more complete program:

<ul>
  <li>Gold Pieces from background.</li>
  <li>Tool proficiencies from background.</li>
  <li>Tool proficiencies from class.</li>
  <li>Armor / weapon proficiencies from class.</li>
  <li>Class by level (hp, magic, ...).</li>
  <li>Languages.</li>
  <li>Equipments.</li>
  <li>Feature from background.</li>
  <li>Feature from class</li>
</ul>
